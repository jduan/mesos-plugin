<div>
    Specifies the resources role that Jenkins scheduler will receive offers
    for. If role is set to "*" (default), it will receive offers for unreserved
    resources. If role is set to something else (e.g., 'jenkins'), it will
    receive offers for BOTH unreserved resources and 'jenkins' resources but
    only use reserved resources of the 'jenkins' role.
